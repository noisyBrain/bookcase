## Objective
Simply for practical and educational purposes, the application aims to be a useful tool for those looking to save or set aside the books they wish to read.

### The application will allow users to:
- Get a book by name 🌶
- Save for "read later" 🌶
- Mark the status of a book, i.e., `STARTED`, `READING`, `FINISHED` 🥑
- Filter by book status 🍆
- Set a **target date** for reading a book. In other words, if a user wants to set a goal to read a book in a month, they can mark the period during which they have time to read it 🍆

🌶 -> essential
🥑 -> desirable
🍆 -> not important
